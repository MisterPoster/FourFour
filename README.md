Android Developer Fundamentals (Version 2) Starter Apps & 4.4 HW
=======================================================
4.4 HW (February 23, 2020) AJT 2020

Create an app with a main Activity and at least three other Activity children. Each Activity should have an options menu and use the v7 appcompat support library Toolbar as the app bar, as shown below.

 - In the main Activity, build a grid layout with images of your own choosing. Three images (donut_circle.png, froyo_circle.png, and icecream_circle.png), which you can download, are provided as part of the DroidCafe app.
 - Resize the images if necessary, so that three of them fit horizontally on the screen in the grid layout.
 - Enable each image to provide navigation to a child Activity. When the user taps the image, it starts a child Activity. From each child Activity, the user should be able to tap the Up button in the app bar (highlighted in the figure below) to return to the main Activity.

 - This was before I learned the zip folder download technique, which is why there are the other fundamental starter applications.
